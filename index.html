    <h2>Personal Statement</h2>
    <p>
      As a co-founder of Universably, I am passionate about creating a platform
      that simplifies the university application process for South African
      students. I lead the web design and development team, ensuring that our
      website is user-friendly, responsive, and secure. I also collaborate with
      other co-founders to develop and execute our business strategy, marketing
      plan, and user research. In addition to my entrepreneurial venture, I am
      pursuing a Bachelor of Science degree in Computer Science at the
      University of the Witwatersrand, where I have honed my problem-solving,
      coding, and analytical skills. I am also a Candidate Fellow at the Allan
      Gray Orbis Foundation, a prestigious program that supports young leaders
      and innovators in Africa. Through this program, I have gained valuable
      mentorship, networking, and funding opportunities, as well as access to
      workshops, seminars, and events that enhance my personal and professional
      growth.
